# Backlog

## What can be improved in the codebase ?

- Aliases for imports to avoid infinite relative imports
- Missing tests for currencies and use cases
- Incomplete documentation in most functions
- Incorrect naming of functions (PascalCase instead of camelCase)
- Complex logic in the "Convert" error catching condition
- Exchange rate verification is not correctly implemented (currency1 + '->' + currency2)
- Simplify the typing of the functions signatures
